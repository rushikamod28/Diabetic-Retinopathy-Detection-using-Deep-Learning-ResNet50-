# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-ResNet50-
Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow and ResNet50 to classify diabetic retinopathy into five severity stages from retinal fundus images. Utilized Dask to efficiently load and process large .parquet image datasets from Hugging Face. Converted raw image bytes into normalized RGB arrays and created optimized tf.data pipelines with batching, shuffling, and prefetching. Employed transfer learning with frozen ResNet50 base and custom dense layers, and trained the model using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. Visualized class distribution and evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
